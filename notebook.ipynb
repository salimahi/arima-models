    "# Demystifying SARIMA Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week I finished a project where I identified the five zip codes in the city of Baltimore, Maryland where an individual would expect the highest return on investment for buying a house, living in the house, then reselling after two years. You can check out my github repository for the project [here](https://github.com/sethchart/Baltimore-Real-Estate-Investment). In that project, I used Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models to forecast house prices based on historical data that I collected from Zillow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post I want to take a closer look at these powerful time series models and try to get some intuition for how they work. A SARIMA model is a fairly complex type of time series model that combines several ideas to provide a flexible framework for modeling time series data. I want to build up the full model slowly and step-by-step so we can get an idea of how each additional piece contributes to the full model."

Then, they would refer to the very first number in the list by the name $w_0$, so $w_0 = 172.6$. This is pretty similar to the way we work with this list in python. If we want the first number in the list, we type `weights[0]` which returns 172.6. The function below lists out all of the numbers in the weights list with both mathematical notation and python syntax."
